Testing of the app shall be done through several steps. 

First, GUI testing is going to be done to make sure that the graphics and Font position are convenient for users. This will be done by installing the GUI on several Android devices with different screen sizes and resolutions and tinkering with the interface to make sure that it is optimal for all the users.

After that, server latency and daily up-time will be tested. These parameters shall be tested by flooding the server with HTTP requests for several days from different devices to get familiar with its maximum load and try to edit the server code and app code to make the user experience smooth and make sure that the server's availability is as close to 24/7 as possible. 

Next, the Search feature should be tested by trying all possible search cases and extremes then comparing the results with the already prepared correct results. 

Last, but not least, the interaction between the app's inner classes will be tested by making different search queries on different days and at random times to make sure that everything fits perfectly.
